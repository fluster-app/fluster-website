## Introduction

Fluster is a platform which aims to simplify the search for roommates and flatshares by using smart features ðŸ˜ƒðŸŽ‰

This repo is the Fluster's website, build with [Angular](http://angular.io).

### Features

* Fluster recommends you flatshares fitting your needs
* With Fluster, you could discover what are the lifestyle and hobbies of your future roommates

* Fluster take care of the calendar of your viewings

## Server-side rendering (SSR)

This Angular application runs on the server. It follows the architecture of the [Angular Universal starter kit](https://github.com/angular/universal-starter). 

## Getting Started

Once you have cloned this repository and if you are looking to serve or build the application, you will have first to define your own third party keys in `resources.ts`.

Also note, both staging and prod builds are going to run first `Gulp` scripts in order to modify some html files because the staging environment should not be indexed by crawlers. 

### Debug locally

Serve the application locally:

```bash
npm run start
```

### Build for staging

Build the application for the staging server:

```bash
npm run build:ssr-staging
```

### Build for production

Build the application for the production:

```bash
npm run build:ssr
```

### Run staging or prod build

Run the application:

```bash
npm run serve
```
